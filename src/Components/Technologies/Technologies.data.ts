Of course, <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> have been my trusted companions throughout my journey. Aside from that, in my latest role I thrived in a dynamic and fast-paced environment where I had the privilege of working with a powerful stack of technologies such as <b>TypeScript</b>, <b>React</b>, <b>SCSS</b>, and <b>Tailwind CSS</b> environment.
  <br/><br/>My previous experiences equipped me with a strong foundation in <b>JavaScript</b>, along with the popular frameworks and libraries like <b>React</b>, <b>Material-UI</b> and <b>Bootstrap</b>. Working within this tech stack allowed me to deliver high-quality, performant, and visually appealing front-end solutions.`,
